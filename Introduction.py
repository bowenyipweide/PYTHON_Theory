Concepts and Applications of Data Structures:
{The data needs to be stored and managed appropriately so that we can retrieve and process the information efficiently}
• Arrays
• Linked Lists
• Stacks
• Queues
• Trees

2 computational problems: 
1. Searching
- Find and search key in a given set
2. Sorting
- Rearrange data of a given set in certain order

Algorithm Design Strategies:
• Brute Force and Exhaustive Search
• Divide-and-Conquer
• Greedy Strategy
• Decrease-and-Conquer
• Transform-and-Conquer
• Iterative Improvement
