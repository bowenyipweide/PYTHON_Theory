To design a hash table for data retrieval, we need to consider
• Hash function
• Collision and its resolutions
• Delete a key from a hash table
• Resizing hash table – Dynamic hash table
Hashing
"""_hash_function(key): A private method that hashes the key and determines
the index in the table.
• insert(key, value): Inserts a key-value pair into the table. If the key already
exists, it updates the value.
• get(key): Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
• delete(key): Deletes the key-value pair if the key exists."""
